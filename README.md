![Getting Started](SpiceWorld.png)

The objective of this project was to create a classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game but add a twist and throw in Lizard and Spock as well. I took the game a step further and changed it from Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock to Posh, Baby, Ginger, Scary, and Sporty.
